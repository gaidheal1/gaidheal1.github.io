## Quests are here!
It took me one day to write most of the code. 
The next day I fixed a bunch of bugs with increasing irritation, having expected to be 'nearly finished'. I gave up fairly late into the night, unable to find the source of one particular bug.. 
The third day (yesterday), I wrote out how things flowed through the script. I moved a bunch of code into new functions so that it made sense, and shuffled the code around to make it easier to find everything when editing. 

Quests are a major feature of the project, and so it's exciting they're finally working.

For fun (and later embarassment), here is a screenshot of the current version of the game:
